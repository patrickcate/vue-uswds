# Installation

**Note:** You will need to load the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov) CSS separately.

Vue USWDS can be installed either by including it with a simple `script` tag or using NPM and a build system.

## Script Tag

The easiest way to include the library with a script tag is to use a CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com). You can also load the library locally on your server.

When using with a script tag all components will be imported.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-uswds/dist/vue-uswds.umd.js"></script>

<script>
  const app = Vue.createApp({})

  app.use(VueUswds, {
    // ...options
  })

  app.mount('#app')
</script>
```

## NPM/Yarn

```shell
npm install vue-uswds
```

or

```shell
yarn install vue-uswds
```
